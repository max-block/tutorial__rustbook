* Every reference has a lifetime. Lifetime is for references only.
* Borrow checker. Borrow, not just a variable!
* All references are valid, the compiler guarantees that.
* A smart pointer is a struct which implements Deref and Drop traits.
* RefCel<T> is for situactions, when we (humans) garantee the borrowing rules (1 mut or many immut), but not the compiler.
